# 👋 Hey there! I'm Rupal Lahre

Welcome to my GitHub corner — where backend magic meets distributed systems with a sprinkle of caffeine ☕.

🚀 I'm a Software Engineer (and an M.Tech grad from IIIT Lucknow) who loves building high-impact backend systems that *just work*. Recently, I wrapped up an exciting internship at **Tesco**, where I built microservices that saved hours of manual work and helped the reverse fulfilment team breathe a little easier!

🛠️ Here's a quick TL;DR on what I do:
- Build RESTful APIs with Java + Spring Boot
- Design resilient distributed systems with Kafka & Couchbase
- Dockerize everything I touch 🐳
- Write clean, testable code (hello, 95% test coverage!)
- Monitor, trace, and debug like a log detective 🕵️

> Let’s connect and build something awesome together!
